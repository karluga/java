# NOTES
## Inheritance
Can add a child class with keyword "extends"
`super()` is used to call the parent constructor
The constructor is named after the class name

## Abstraction
Interfaces have only abstract methods and they have to be only public
They can contain only public methods


abstract Class - partial abstraction
interface Class - 100% abstraction
abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation detail
when we send a message, we do not know the process of sending the message, but we only know what it does and doesnt know how it does it
abstract methods cannot be final or static


an abstract method can not be included in a normal class, but only in an abstract class

java allows implementing multipe interfaces with keyword "implements"
